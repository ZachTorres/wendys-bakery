2. Add your images to the folder
3. Replace the `.image-placeholder` divs with `<img>` tags:

```html
<!-- Before -->
<div class="image-placeholder hero-placeholder">
    <i class="fas fa-birthday-cake"></i>
    <p>Hero Image</p>
</div>

<!-- After -->
<img src="images/your-image.jpg" alt="Description">
